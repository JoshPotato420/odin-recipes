  <h3>Filipino Mango Float</h3>

  <p>This no-bake dessert is a delightful combination of creamy whipped cream, sweet mangoes, and crunchy graham crackers. It's easy to make but requires chilling overnight for the perfect texture. So worth the wait!</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups heavy cream, chilled overnight</li>
    <li>Â½ cup condensed milk, chilled overnight</li>
    <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    <li>4 ripe mangoes, chopped or sliced</li>
    <li>2 packs graham crackers</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Mangoes: Ensure your mangoes are ripe and sweet. Peel, then chop or thinly slice them. Set aside.</li><br>
    <li>Whip the Cream:In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Gradually add the salt and condensed milk, then continue whipping until stiff peaks form.</li><br>
    <li>Assemble the Float: Crush the graham crackers to your desired consistency, or leave them whole. In an 8x8 inch glass container, layer the ingredients: graham crackers, whipped cream, and mangoes. Repeat once more, finishing with whipped cream and mangoes. Optionally, decorate with additional graham cracker crumbs.</li><br>
    <li>Chill or Freeze: Cover the container and refrigerate overnight for a soft texture or freeze overnight for an ice cream-like consistency. Thaw for 30 minutes before serving, adjusting the time based on your desired texture.</li><br>
